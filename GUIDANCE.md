# Guidance for Users of ki-web-toolkit [CE]

## Purpose of This Document

This document outlines the expectations we have for organizations, particularly hosting institutions and SaaS providers, who include this project in their offerings. While the software is released under an open-source license, maintaining and developing web-toolkit is both time-consuming and expensive. We are committed to open source and believe in its power to create collaborative and sustainable software ecosystems. However, we also need support to ensure the long-term viability of this project not just for ourselves, but for the full value chain of open source software that we in turn rely upon.

## Our Expectations for Responsible Use and Ethical Monetisation

### 1. Acknowledegment of the Open Source Effort

If you include ki-web-toolkit in a SaaS offering, we kindly ask that you provide proper attribution and acknowledgment of our work. This could include:

- A visible mention of Knowledge Integration Web Toolkit in your product documentation, marketing materials, or website.
- Acknowledgment of the contributors and community that supports KI Web Toolkit.

Please do not silently include this library in a component you are selling without acknowledgement

### 2. Support for Maintenance and Development

Self Hosting and SaaS providers who derive value/revenue from KI Web Toolkit in a production setting should recognize the ongoing costs involved in maintaining and improving the software. We ask that:

- **Organizations Using KI Web Toolkit at Scale or in a production environment**: If you are not already supporting us through some other route, please consider formalizing your support of our work through a recurring sponsorship agreement. This helps us allocate resources to ensure the stability, security, and growth of the project. If every institution that uses a module based on KI Web Toolkit contributed just GBP25/month we could afford to proactively patch and maintain this module without drawing resource away from our feature development programmes. Modules which include this component, or hosting providers offering this as SAAS might bundle this cost into their offering transparently. Remember that we are trying to leverage scale here, so that the cost to each institution is trivial but the network effect is sustainable software... it helps nobody if hosting providers pay USD5 for a cluster of 300 institutions. Please engage with this request in good faith and consider "What we owe to each other". You can support us at the suggested support level of GBP25/institution/Month using the links that follow.

- **Collaboration on Security**: Promptly report any security vulnerabilities you discover, and work with us to develop and distribute patches.

## Why This Matters

Open-source software thrives on community and collaboration. However, building and maintaining software (especially in a world of CVRs and demands for immediate patching) requires resources, including time, money, and effort. We believe that everyone benefiting from KI Web Toolkit has a role to play in its sustainability. Your support, financial sponsorship, or active community engagement, ensures that KI Web Toolkit remains robust, secure, and available for all.

## Conclusion

We value and appreciate every user of KI Web Toolkit, and we understand the diverse ways in which our software may be used. By meeting the expectations outlined in this document, you help us maintain a healthy and sustainable open-source project that continues to benefit everyone.

Thank you for your understanding and support.
